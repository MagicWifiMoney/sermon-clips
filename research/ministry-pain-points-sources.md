## Source 1: ChurchSocial.ai Article - Video Editing for Beginners

### Primary Pain Points

**Time Constraints**
- "The biggest challenge for most churches isn't a lack of meaningful content—you have that in abundance! The real struggle is finding the time and technical skill to package it for social media."
- Churches need to turn one sermon into a week's worth of content
- 1.5-2 hours of editing + exporting per video (from Facebook group mention)

**Technical Skill Gap**
- Many church leaders and volunteers feel overwhelmed by video editing
- Don't need Hollywood-level tools but struggle with complex software learning curves
- Need tools that work for first-time volunteers, not just tech-savvy staff

**Fragmented Workflow**
- Old process: Edit clips in one program → Design graphics in another → Post to multiple social platforms separately → Track on spreadsheet
- "It's exhausting just thinking about it"
- Impossible to keep branding consistent across platforms

**Resource Constraints**
- Can't afford to hire professional video editors
- All-volunteer teams managing social media
- Budget limitations (need affordable solutions)

**Multi-Platform Management**
- Need to post to YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok
- Each platform requires different formats/aspect ratios
- Managing multiple accounts is time-consuming

**Content Identification**
- Difficulty identifying the "gold-nugget moments" from long sermons
- Need to find powerful quotes, key illustrations, shareable segments
- Manual process is time-intensive

**Consistency Challenges**
- Hard to maintain consistent branding across all content
- Difficult to keep up regular posting schedule
- "Multiply ministry impact, not workload"

### Desired Solutions
- All-in-one platform (editing + graphics + scheduling)
- AI-powered clip identification
- Simple, beginner-friendly tools
- Integration with church management systems (Planning Center mentioned)
- Drag-and-drop calendar for scheduling
- Template libraries for consistent branding
- Automated transcription
- Multi-platform posting from one dashboard

## Market Context
- Video editing software market: $2.29B in 2024, expected $3.73B by 2033
- Growing demand for user-friendly, accessible tools
- Churches specifically need ministry-focused solutions, not general video editors

### The 4 Major Struggles

**1. Gaining Social Media Followers**
- Churches struggle to build audience on social platforms
- Rare to attract external audiences if members don't want the content
- Need to promote to members first, then expand
- Platform choice paralysis (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok)
- Best practice: Start with limited channels, build on success
- Need keyword-rich descriptions, hashtags, and potentially paid ads/boosted posts

**2. Creating Better Social Media Content**
- "When you enter a room of people and are given the microphone, what you say is critical"
- Content quality determines whether people will listen
- Balance between what audience wants vs. what church wants to share
- Risk: Too much promotion causes follower loss
- Need to understand audience needs, concerns, and goals
- Visual posts (photos/videos) preferred over text-only
- Videos need captions (most don't turn sound on while scrolling)
- Need consistent "thread" or brand identity
- Goal: "I love your posts because they're always ___"

**3. Optimal Posting Times**
- Need to post when followers are scrolling (bored moments)
- Common times: first thing in morning, breaks, lunch, after kids' bedtime
- Mid-morning Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays work best
- Mid-evening on weeknights also good
- Challenge: "How can you possibly keep this schedule up without it controlling your life?"
- Need scheduling apps/tools
- Must monitor for world events that could make scheduled posts inappropriate

**4. Getting Social Media Engagement**
- Power proven through likes, comments, shares
- If seeing none of these, need to adjust content or timing
- Requires monitoring feeds and replying to comments
- Need to engage with members' social media
- "If you're not engaging, they probably won't either"
- Takes consistency over time
- Can be discouraging due to lack of engagement

### Key Insights
- Social media reaches two audiences: external (needing gospel) and internal (disciples)
- Half the world's population uses social media
- Churches need ongoing conversation, not just broadcast
- Need to coordinate social media with pastor/ministry areas
- Scheduling tools are essential but require monitoring
- Success requires balancing what audience wants with ministry goals

### Real-World Pain Point: Overwhelmed One-Person Team

**Quote from Wanga Raphael Majali (June 2024):**
> "I took over the church media ministry and i have an overload of unedited footage, i am currently the only one who can edit and basically the typical one man team kind of guy."

**Specific Challenges:**
- **Footage Backlog**: "The footage keeps piling and i am overwhelmed"
- **Solo Operation**: "Currently the only one who can edit" - typical one-man team
- **Can't Justify New Tools**: "Can't even ask for new gear cause it would seem as if we're failing to use the least we have"
- **Stopped Streaming**: Had to stop streaming because members were "worshiping online" instead of attending in person (pastoral concern)
- **Progress Hindered**: Backlog prevents moving forward with improvements

### Community Responses Reveal Additional Insights:

**From Moderator Glynn Brockway:**
- "We cannot do this alone... however, when you don't have many folks, you just don't have many folks"
- Acknowledges the reality: small churches simply don't have volunteer resources
- "I feel your pain!" - widespread empathy for this situation

**From Roy Nelson:**
- Records, edits, and uploads twice a week (one full service, one sermon only)
- Uses mobile phone (Android) with YouCut app for editing
- Minimal editing: trimming, splits, volume adjustments
- Transfers to phone to edit on-the-go

**From Bhrawijaya Dwi:**
- One camera only setup
- Records in 4K but edits in 1080p to enable digital zoom
- Only zooms for sermon portions
- No effects, no transitions, no subtitles
- Audio recorded separately
- 1.5-2 hours editing + exporting time (mentioned in post)
- Uses old PC (i5 gen 9 + GTX1650 + 16GB RAM)

### Key Insights:
1. **One-person teams are common** in small churches
2. **Backlog/overwhelm is a major issue** - footage piles up faster than can be edited
3. **Minimal editing is the norm** due to time constraints
4. **Mobile editing is used** out of necessity/convenience
5. **Equipment limitations** compound time problems (slow exports)
6. **Can't justify investment** when appearing to fail with current tools
7. **Pastoral concerns** about online vs. in-person attendance affect streaming decisions


## Source 4: Ministry Brands - Church Metrics to Track in 2026

### Key Metrics Churches Care About

**1. Worship Attendance (In-Person + Online)**
- Need to track both physical and digital reach
- Livestream viewers and on-demand engagement
- "Tracking only in-room attendance can significantly underrepresent your actual reach"

**2. Guest Retention & Next-Step Movement**
- Guest return rate
- Percentage taking next steps (joining group, serving, attending class, membership)
- "Strong next-step pathway is often a stronger predictor of long-term growth than raw visitor numbers"

**3. Spiritual Milestones**
- Baptisms, decisions for Christ, membership commitments
- Measure Gospel impact rather than just activity
- "The ultimate goal isn't attendance growth, but life transformation"

**4. Discipleship & Small Group Engagement**
- Participation and consistency in small groups, classes, discipleship pathways
- "Weekend services may attract people, but discipleship forms them"
- Need to track not just how many join, but how consistently they engage

**5. Volunteer Engagement & Retention**
- Percentage of attendees serving
- Volunteer retention rates
- Leadership pipeline growth
- "A strong volunteer culture often reflects a strong sense of ownership"

**6. Giving Health**
- Percentage of givers vs. attendees
- Recurring giving adoption
- Average gift per household
- Need to understand if giving is broad-based or concentrated

**7. Member Retention & Engagement Frequency**
- How often people engage (not just how many names in database)
- Consistency across attendance, giving, serving, group involvement
- "Identify disengagement early and proactively care for people before they drift away"

**8. Digital Engagement & Communication Effectiveness**
- **Email open and click rates**
- **Text/SMS engagement**
- **Website traffic**
- **Sermon engagement throughout the week** ← KEY PAIN POINT
- "Digital communication matters more than ever"
- Need to understand how effectively communicating vision beyond Sunday

### Critical Insight for Sermon Clips:
**"Sermon engagement throughout the week"** is now a tracked metric. Churches need to:
- Extend sermon impact beyond Sunday
- Measure how people engage with sermon content during the week
- Track digital engagement with sermon-related content
- Balance reach, depth, and impact

**The Problem:**
- Ministry in 2026 is "more hybrid, more relational, and more discipleship-driven than ever"
- Old metrics (just attendance and giving) "no longer tell the whole story"
- Need "mission-aligned, people-focused insights"
- Churches need "clearer visibility into how people are engaging with the mission"

**The Opportunity:**
Tools that help churches track sermon engagement throughout the week directly address a key metric churches now need to measure.
