# Church Communications Pain Points by ICP
## Comprehensive Research Summary

---

## ICP 1: Church Communications Director

### Profile
- Oversees all church communications (live streams, recordings, social media, announcements)
- Manages volunteers with varying skill levels
- Reports to senior pastor
- Typically requires bachelor's degree in communications
- Often a one-person department in small-to-mid churches

### Top Pain Points

#### 1. Overwhelming Scope of Responsibilities
**Quote:** "The communications director's sole responsibility is to work with the communications of the church. They are the ones making sure that the live broadcasts of the church are being put online for those to see who cannot make it, they make sure that the sermons are being recorded and uploaded to wherever the church uploads their sermons to, and they make sure that the church is staying up to date on announcements for each ministry."

**Impact:** Responsible for EVERYTHING - live streaming, recording, uploading, social media, announcements, website, graphics, etc.

#### 2. Time Constraints
**Quote:** "How can you possibly keep this schedule up without it controlling your life?"

**Specifics:**
- Weekly clips, captions, thumbnails across IG, FB, TikTok, YouTube
- 1.5-2 hours editing + exporting per video
- Need to turn one sermon into a week's worth of content
- Balancing live production with post-production

#### 3. Fragmented Workflow
**Quote:** "You edit sermon clips in one program. Then you hop over to another to design a quote graphic. Next, you log into three different social media accounts to post everything. And you're trying to keep track of it all on a separate spreadsheet. It's exhausting just thinking about it."

**Impact:** 
- Multiple software subscriptions needed
- No centralized system
- Impossible to maintain consistent branding
- Eats up time and creates errors

#### 4. Preventing Technical Difficulties
**Pressure:** "Ensure a service without technical difficulties to the best of their ability"

**Reality:**
- Live streaming can't have errors
- Managing volunteers who may make mistakes
- Equipment limitations
- High-pressure, high-visibility role

#### 5. Volunteer Management
**Challenge:** "Overseeing the volunteers of the media to ensure a service without technical difficulties"

**Issues:**
- Training volunteers with varying skill levels
- Volunteer turnover
- Coordinating schedules
- Maintaining quality with inconsistent team

#### 6. Can't Justify Investment When Overwhelmed
**Quote:** "Can't even ask for new gear cause it would seem as if we're failing to use the least we have"

**Catch-22:** Overwhelmed by current workload → Can't demonstrate success → Can't get budget for tools that would help

## ICP 2: Social Media Manager (Church)

### Profile
- Dedicated to social media presence across multiple platforms
- Collaborates with pastoral and creative teams
- Produces, manages, and analyzes content
- Often volunteer or part-time role

### Top Pain Points

#### 1. Burnout from Constant Content Creation
**Quote:** "I've been managing social media for multiple churches for the past 2 years and counting. Weekly clips, captions, thumbnails, and posting across IG, FB, TikTok, and YouTube. I'm happy to share workflows, tools, checklists, and ways to avoid burnout."

**Reality:** Burnout is so common it's the first thing mentioned when offering to help others

#### 2. Lack of Source Material
**Quote:** "How do you make content when there's nothing going on worth posting about? What about when there's not enough photos or videos available?"

**Challenge:**
- Need constant stream of content
- Limited raw material to work with
- Can't always be at events to capture footage
- Sermons are most consistent content source

#### 3. Platform-Specific Requirements
**Quote:** "TikTok wants vertical. YouTube wants landscape. It's exhausting."

**Specifics:**
- Different aspect ratios per platform
- Different caption styles
- Different optimal posting times
- Different audience expectations
- Manual reformatting is time-intensive

#### 4. Balancing Promotion vs. Value
**Quote:** "Resist too much promotion or you'll start to lose followers. Instead, consider how you want your followers to complete this sentence about your social media: 'I love your posts because they're always _____.'"

**Challenge:**
- Can't just promote events
- Need to provide consistent value
- Build brand identity
- Keep content feeling authentic, not salesy

#### 5. Engagement Challenges
**Quote:** "If you're not engaging, they probably won't either."

**Requirements:**
- Monitor feeds constantly
- Reply to comments
- Like and comment on members' posts
- Start conversations
- Time-intensive relationship building

#### 6. Scheduling Consistency
**Quote:** "How can you possibly keep this schedule up without it controlling your life? It's difficult, but scheduling apps help."

**Challenge:**
- Need to post when audience is scrolling (mid-morning, mid-evening)
- Multiple posts per week across multiple platforms
- Must monitor for world events that could make scheduled posts inappropriate
- Scheduling tools help but still require constant oversight

- Handles everything: recording, editing, uploading, social media
- Usually volunteer or part-time
- Common in small churches

### Top Pain Points

#### 1. Overwhelming Backlog
**Quote:** "I took over the church media ministry and i have an overload of unedited footage, i am currently the only one who can edit and basically the typical one man team kind of guy... the footage keeps piling and i am overwhelmed."

**Vicious Cycle:**
- Inherit backlog from previous person
- Can't keep up with weekly new content

**Quote:** "I am currently the only one who can edit"

**Reality:**

- All knowledge in one person
- High stress, high burnout risk

#### 3. Limited Resources
**Quote:** "I use old PC, i5 gen 9 + gtx1650 + 16 Gb RAM. It takes around 1.5 - 2 hours of editing + exporting the final file in 1080p."

**Compounding Factors:**
- Slow equipment makes editing take longer
- Can't afford upgrades
- Time constraints make backlog worse
- Equipment limitations prevent efficiency

#### 4. Minimal Editing Due to Time
**Quote:** "I record the service in 4k, but edit the footage in 1080p. Why? Because that way I can zoom digitally. I only zoom in digitally for sermon. That is all, no effects, no video transitions, no subtitles."

**Survival Mode:**
- Bare minimum editing to get something out
- No time for polish or creativity
- Just trying to keep up with basics
- Quality suffers due to time constraints

#### 5. No Help Available
**Quote from Moderator:** "We cannot do this alone... however, when you don't have many folks, you just don't have many folks... I feel your pain!"
