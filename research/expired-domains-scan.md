## Research Limitations & Next Steps

### Limitations Encountered:
1. **Rate limiting** on Brave Search API (free tier: 1 req/sec, 2000/month)
2. **Login walls** on ExpiredDomains.net, DomCop (full metrics require paid accounts)
3. **Incomplete backlink data** without Majestic/Ahrefs API access
4. **Search noise** - most results are general church news, not expired domains

### Recommended Next Steps:

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Monitor tracked domains daily** - Set up WHOIS alerts for sermondrop.com (4 days), sermonshots.com (17 days), sermoncloud.com (41 days)
2. **Backorder all three** via SnapNames, NameJet, or GoDaddy backorder service
3. **Budget allocation**: Expect $60-300 per domain in backorder/auction fees

#### Ongoing Monitoring:
1. **Set up automated checks:**
   - ABTdomain.com daily pending delete lists (filter for 20+ year domains with "church", "ministry", "sermon", "worship", "faith", "gospel", "parish" keywords)
   - ExpiredDomains.net GoDaddy auctions with bids (updated every minute)
   - Karma.domains aggregated feeds from multiple auction platforms

2. **Subscribe to premium tools (optional):**
   - DomCop ($39/mo) - 90+ metrics from Majestic, Moz, Ahrefs, SEMrush
   - ExpiredDomains.net Pro ($20-50/mo) - full filtering, no ads, API access

3. **Search patterns to monitor weekly:**
   - `site:expireddomains.net (church OR sermon OR ministry OR worship)`
   - `pending delete domains "faith" OR "gospel" OR "pastor"`
   - Manual browse of GoDaddy expired auctions filtered by age (15+ years) + keyword searches

#### Verification Workflow:
For any promising domain found:
1. Check Archive.org Wayback Machine - what was it?
2. Quick Majestic/Ahrefs lookup (even free tier shows top metrics)
3. Google search for `site:domain.com` - any indexed pages?
4. Check for trademark conflicts
5. Estimate value vs. backorder cost
