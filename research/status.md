## Key Findings Snapshot

### Top Performers:
- **Mega Influencers:** Juan Pablo Lerman, Mike Jr., Jerry Eze (2M+ each)
- **Format Winner:** 30-90 second clips with strong hooks and auto-captions
- **Viral Topics:** Relationships, purpose, confronting sin, practical wisdom
- **Best Denominations:** Non-denominational, Charismatic/Pentecostal

### Critical Success Factors:
- Authenticity over production quality
- Hook in first 3 seconds (question or pain point)
- Universal accessibility (Christians + non-Christians)
- Auto-captions and text overlays (algorithm + accessibility)
- Seasonal content (Christmas/Easter has long-tail value)

### Common Failures:
- Overly produced content (feels corporate)
- No hook/slow starts (users scroll within 3 seconds)
- Just posting announcements (no value)
- Ignoring captions/text (accessibility penalty)
- Treating TikTok like Facebook
