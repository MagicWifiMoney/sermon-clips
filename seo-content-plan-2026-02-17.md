Based on existing 5 ICP pages + 5 use-case pages, consider adding:

1. **"For Worship Leaders"** — Worship teams often manage social media; different angle from pastors
2. **"For Church Volunteers"** — Many churches rely on volunteers for social media; emphasize ease-of-use
3. **"For Multi-Campus Churches"** — Unique pain point: consistent branding across locations
4. **Use Case: "Sermon Series Promotion"** — Using clips to promote upcoming sermon series
5. **Use Case: "Member Engagement & Outreach"** — Clips for evangelism/visitor follow-up
