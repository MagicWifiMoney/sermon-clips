**Caption (Reel or single image):**

Your sermon says something powerful every Sunday.

But if it's not transcribed, it's basically invisible to the rest of the world. 🔇

No blog post. No captions for clips. No SEO. No quote cards. No study guide.

That changes with AI transcription — and it's faster than you think.

We just published the complete guide 👇

### Twitter/X (Thread)

**Tweet 1:**
```
Most churches record their sermons.

Almost none of them transcribe them.

That's leaving 10+ pieces of content on the table every single week. 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
A sermon transcript unlocks:

• Clip captions (85% watch muted — no captions = half your message is gone)
• Blog posts
• Email newsletters
• Quote cards
• Study guides
• SEO content
• Translations (30+ languages)

All from ONE 45-minute recording.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The old way: hire a transcriptionist, wait 24-48 hrs, pay $50-100/sermon

The AI way: upload your audio, get it back in minutes, 95%+ accuracy with decent mic setup

The church media landscape changed fast.

Here's something that doesn't get talked about enough in church communications:

Sermon transcription is the #1 unlocked content lever for most churches.

Every Sunday, your pastor delivers a prepared, researched, spiritually rich message — often 30-45 minutes of original content. That's more than most podcasters, content creators, or thought leaders produce in a week.

But in most churches, that content lives on one platform (YouTube or Facebook Live) and is never touched again.

The transcript changes that.

From a single transcript, a church media team can produce:
→ 3–5 short-form clips with accurate captions
→ A full blog post (repurposed, not copy-pasted)
→ 2–3 email newsletter segments
→ 5–10 quote cards
→ A discussion/study guide
→ Translated content for international congregation members
→ A searchable archive of every sermon ever preached

AI transcription is now accurate enough (95%+ with a decent setup) and fast enough (minutes, not days) to make this workflow real for even a volunteer-run media team.

We published a complete guide covering the tech, the accuracy benchmarks, the 10 use cases, and a step-by-step workflow:

Worth sharing with anyone running church comms, podcast production, or faith-based media.
