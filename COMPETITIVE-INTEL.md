## 2. MARKET ANALYSIS

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

| Metric | Number | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Religious congregations in US | ~370,000 | Hartford Institute |
| Churches (Protestant/Catholic) | ~257,000 | Rentech Digital (2025) |
| Churches creating video content (est.) | ~75,000-100,000 | ~30-40% stream or record sermons |
| Churches active on social media | ~120,000-150,000 | ~50-60% have social presence |
| Churches that would pay for clip tools | ~25,000-50,000 | ~10-20% adoption ceiling |

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)
- **Target:** Churches that record sermons AND want social media presence
- **Estimate:** ~50,000-75,000 churches in the US
- **At $39/mo average:** $23M-$35M annual TAM for self-serve SaaS
- **At $500/mo average (service):** $300M-$450M for done-for-you

### Pricing Sweet Spot Analysis

| Tier | Monthly Price | Target Church Size | Willingness to Pay |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Entry/Free | $0-$19 | Under 100 members | Low — need free/cheap |
| Core SaaS | $29-$59 | 100-500 members | Sweet spot — most churches |
| Premium SaaS | $79-$129 | 500-2,000 members | Willing if value is clear |
| Done-For-You | $499-$2,000+ | 1,000+ members | Budget exists, time doesn't |

**Key insight:** The $29-$59/mo range is where most competitors cluster. This is the proven sweet spot. Below $20 works for entry/trial. Above $100 needs significant value differentiation.

## 4. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATION

### Business Model: Hybrid (SaaS-First + Service Upsell)

**Why hybrid:**
- SaaS ($29-$79/mo) scales without linear headcount
- Service tier ($199-$499/mo) captures higher willingness-to-pay from larger churches
- Service tier provides learning data to improve the SaaS product
- Service can be the "white glove onboarding" that converts to self-serve

### Recommended Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Price | Target | Includes |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Lead gen | 2 clips/mo, watermark |
| **Starter** | $29/mo | Small churches | 4 sermons/mo, unlimited clips, captions, basic templates |
| **Growth** | $59/mo | Mid-size churches | Unlimited sermons, custom branding, scheduling, devotionals, discussion guides |
| **Pro** | $99/mo | Large churches | Multi-campus, team access, analytics, priority processing |
| **Done-For-You** | $299-$499/mo | Churches with budget, no time | We edit, post, manage — they approve |

### Differentiation Opportunities

1. **Mosaic/Tile-based layouts** — Unique visual style competitors don't have (our existing tech)
2. **One-click sermon → full content calendar** — Upload sermon, get clips + captions + graphics + devotional + discussion guide
3. **Church branding system** — Logo, colors, fonts automatically applied to every clip
4. **YouTube-native integration** — Pull directly from church YouTube channel (like Outreach Social)
5. **Multi-platform auto-posting** — Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Facebook in one click
6. **Planning Center / ChMS integration** — Ties into existing church workflow
7. **Analytics that matter to pastors** — Not just views, but "new visitors attributed to social"

### What Competitors Are Missing (Our Gaps to Exploit)

- **Price-to-value ratio** — Outreach Social at $19/mo is the floor, but most tools at $39-$59 still feel generic
- **Design quality** — Most AI clips look the same (centered speaker, animated captions). Our Mosaic layouts could stand out
- **Simplicity** — Many tools require too many steps. The winner will be "upload → done"
- **Vertical integration** — No one owns the full pipeline from recording to posting to analytics well

### Year 1 Revenue Model (Conservative)

| Month | Customers | MRR | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----|-------|
| 1-3 | 20 | $1,000 | Beta users, free + discounted |
| 4-6 | 75 | $3,750 | Launch, YouTube content starts working |
| 7-9 | 200 | $10,000 | Word of mouth, conference season |
| 10-12 | 400 | $20,000 | Organic growth compounds |
| **Year 1 Total** | | **~$125K ARR** | |

**Optimistic scenario** (strong YouTube + partnerships): $250K-$400K ARR by end of Year 1  
**Conservative scenario** (slow organic): $60K-$100K ARR by end of Year 1

### Key Risks

1. **Commoditization** — AI clipping is becoming table stakes. Differentiation must come from design quality and church-specific features
2. **Low switching costs** — Churches can try competitors easily. Retention depends on workflow lock-in
3. **Church budget sensitivity** — Many churches cut tech spend first during downturns
4. **Platform dependency** — Social media algorithm changes can reduce clip effectiveness

### Year 1 Priorities

1. **Build the core SaaS** — Upload sermon → get clips with branded captions and Mosaic layouts
2. **YouTube channel** — 2 videos/week, targeting "sermon clips" and "church social media" keywords
3. **Free tier** — 2 clips/mo to drive word of mouth
4. **10 beta churches** — Get testimonials and case studies before paid launch
5. **Conference presence** — Church Communications Conference (Sept 2026), CFX
6. **Integration** — YouTube pull, Planning Center integration

## 5. BOTTOM LINE

**The market is real and growing.** ~50K-75K US churches need sermon clip solutions. The market is fragmented — no dominant winner yet. Pricing clusters at $39-$59/mo for SaaS, $500-$2K/mo for services.

**Our edge:** Mosaic visual layouts (unique), AI-first approach, potential to undercut on price while over-delivering on design quality.

**Realistic Year 1 target:** $100K-$250K ARR with 200-500 paying churches.

**Go/No-Go:** **GO** — but only if we ship fast (next 3-6 months) and invest in YouTube content marketing as the primary distribution channel. The window is open but closing as more tools enter the space.
