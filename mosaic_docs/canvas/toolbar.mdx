The toolbar lives on the left side of your canvas. Here's what each tool does:

| Icon | Tool | What it does |
|:---:|---|---|
| <Icon icon="arrow-pointer" /> | **Select** | Click and select tiles on your canvas to move, edit, or connect them |
| <Icon icon="hand" /> | **Pan** | Grab and drag to move around the canvas freely — no tiles affected |
| <Icon icon="magnifying-glass-plus" /> | **Zoom In** | Get a closer look at a specific part of your canvas |
| <Icon icon="magnifying-glass-minus" /> | **Zoom Out** | Pull back to see more of your workflow at once |
| <Icon icon="rectangle" /> | **Fit** | Instantly auto-center and fit your entire workflow into view |
| <Icon icon="keyboard" /> | **Keyboard Shortcuts** | View all available shortcuts to speed up your editing |

<Tip>**Pro tip:** Use **Fit** when you lose track of your tiles — it snaps everything back into view instantly.</Tip>
