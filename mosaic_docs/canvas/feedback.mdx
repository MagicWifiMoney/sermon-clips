If something isn't working right — or if you have an idea that would make Mosaic better — click the **Feedback** button in the top left of your canvas.

## What You Can Report

- **Bugs** — something broke, an export failed, or a tile isn't behaving as expected
- **Suggestions** — a feature you'd love to see, a workflow improvement, or a UX tweak
- **Questions** — stuck on something? Let us know and we'll help you out

<Note>We actively review every piece of feedback. If your export is slow or something feels off, this is the fastest way to get it resolved.</Note>
