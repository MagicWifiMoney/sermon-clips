Control who can see your Mosaic using the **Share** button in the top right of your canvas. There are two sharing modes:

---

## Private Share

<Icon icon="lock" /> **Only the author can view**

Your Mosaic is locked to your account. No one else can access it — this is the default for every new Mosaic.

Best for:
- Work in progress
- Internal drafts
- Anything not ready for external eyes

---

## Public Share

<Icon icon="globe" /> **Anyone with the link can view**

Generate a shareable link that lets anyone view your Mosaic — including the full workflow, tiles, and outputs.

Best for:
- **Publicly sharing your Mosaics** with your audience or community
- **Sharing workflows and templates** so others can learn from or remix your setup
- **Showcasing your work** on social media, portfolios, or blogs

<Tip>**Affiliate tip:** Sharing your Mosaics publicly can also benefit you if you're a [Mosaic Affiliate](/how-to/affiliate-program). When people discover Mosaic through your shared workflows, you earn **20% of revenue** from every purchase they make.</Tip>
