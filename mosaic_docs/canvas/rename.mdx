## Why Renaming Matters

As your workflow grows — more tiles, more branches, more outputs — it gets harder to keep track of what each Mosaic does. A clear name and description help you:

- **Find the right Mosaic instantly** when you have dozens of projects
- **Remember what a workflow does** weeks or months after you built it
- **Stay organized across clients, projects, and platforms** without second-guessing

<Tip>**Good naming habit:** Use a format like `[Client] - [Project] - [Platform]` to keep things clean. For example: `Acme Corp - Product Demo - YouTube`.</Tip>

## What You Can Edit

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Name** | The main title shown on your canvas and in your Mosaic list |
| **Description** | A short note to remind you (or your team) what this workflow is for |

The earlier you start naming and describing your Mosaics, the easier it is to manage everything as your library grows.
