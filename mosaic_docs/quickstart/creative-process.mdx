The Mosaic creative flow has 3 simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Input Footage">
    Upload or import your raw video — from your device, Google Drive, Dropbox, or a link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tiles">
    Connect creation and action tiles to build your editing workflow visually.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export or Share">
    Publish to social platforms, export files, or share your Mosaic publicly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Think of it like a storyboard for automation — each tile is a creative or technical decision.

## Three Types of Tiles

Every tile falls into one of three categories:

| Type | Role | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Input Tiles** | Bring media in | Video Upload, YouTube Trigger |
| **Creation Tiles** | Generate new media | AI Avatar, AI B-Roll, AI Music |
| **Action Tiles** | Modify existing media | Captions, Reframe, Silence Removal |

The pattern is always the same: **bring it in, create what's missing, shape it into something great.**
