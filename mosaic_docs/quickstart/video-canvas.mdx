The canvas is your workspace — everything in Mosaic happens here. It's a visual, infinite space where you build editing workflows by connecting tiles.

On the canvas you can:

- **Upload footage** — drag and drop or use the Video Input tile
- **Add tiles** — double-click anywhere to open the tile picker
- **Preview results** — watch outputs directly in the canvas
- **Branch workflows** — create multiple edits from the same source
- **Re-run anytime** — tweak settings and run again instantly
- **Share or export** — publish to platforms or download your files

Every Mosaic workflow is visual, modular, and editable at any time.
