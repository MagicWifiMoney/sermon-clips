Editing has always required specialists, timelines, and dozens of manual steps. Mosaic flips this model:

- You build your edit using **decisions**, not tools. 
- You connect **Tiles**, not timelines.
- You output **platform-ready videos**, not raw exports.

You tell Mosaic **what you want** (e.g. "clip this", "add captions", "add b-roll"), and Mosaic handles the heavy lifting.
