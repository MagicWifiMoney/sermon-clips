Answers to the most common questions about using Mosaic.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why is my export slow?" icon="clock">
  Sometimes exports may take longer due to larger or more complex workflows — this is normal for multi-tile pipelines with heavy AI processing.

  If it persists, just click the **Feedback** button on your canvas and we'll help you resolve it as soon as possible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do credits work?" icon="coins">
  Credits are consumed based on the AI models and tiles you use in your workflows. Different tiles and models have different credit costs depending on the processing involved.

  You can view your current usage anytime by going to **Settings > Usage** in the Mosaic editor.
