Automatically create a montage by stitching together multiple videos or clips with rhythm, pacing, and style. This is ideal for fast recap videos, highlight reels, travel edits, product showcases, or hype sequences.

Montage helps you turn raw media into something visually exciting without manually aligning clips or matching beats.

## How It Works

The Montage tile takes one or more input clips and arranges them into a cohesive sequence based on your creative style prompt. It can optionally sync cuts to music, making it feel more cinematic or energetic.

## Input & Options

### 1. Style Prompt (Required)

> _"How do you want the montage to look?"_

Describe the visual pacing and tone.\
Good examples:

- "Energetic montage with quick cuts"
- "Slow emotional montage with long shots"
- "TikTok-style fast-paced montage with hard cuts"
- "Cinematic travel montage with smooth transitions"
- "Sports highlight reel with snappy edits"

This tells Mosaic _how_ to arrange your clips.

### 2. Audio Track (Optional)

You can **upload your own music** to control pacing.

Why use audio?

- Helps drive emotion
- Syncs cuts to beat (if BPM is provided)
- Gives more cinematic output

If no audio is uploaded:

- Mosaic will time clips based on visual pacing only.

### 3. Desired BPM (Optional)

If you provide music, you can enter a **beats per minute** value.

Examples:

- `60–90` → slow, emotional
- `100–130` → upbeat, pop
- `130–160+` → energetic, hype, sports

Mosaic uses BPM to:

- Decide cut frequency
- Match energy level
- Improve beat synchronization

If unsure, you can leave it as-is or remove it entirely.
