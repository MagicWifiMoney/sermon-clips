Apply targeted AI visual changes to a small segment of your video (up to 5 seconds). This can modify the look, style, environment, or visuals of that specific moment without re-generating the entire video.

## How It Works

AI Augment takes a short slice of your clip and applies the visual transformation described in your instructions. You control both the **edit instructions** and the **time segment** that will be modified.

## Input & Settings

### Edit Instructions (Required)

Tell the AI what change you want.\
Examples:

- "Make it space-themed"
- "Turn background into a classroom"
- "Convert to anime style"
- "Add rain and neon lighting"
- "Make it look like a 90s VHS scene"
- "Change outfit to a red hoodie"

Be specific about **style**, **context**, or **effects** for better results.

### Time Segment

Defines where the effect is applied.

You set:

- **Start Time (seconds)**
- **End Time (seconds)**

**Maximum duration:** 5 seconds

This ensures augmentations are controlled and efficient.
