Flip your video horizontally or vertically. This is useful for correcting mirrored webcam footage, achieving creative effects, or adjusting composition for platform layouts.

## How It Works

The Mirror tile applies a flip transformation to your entire video. You choose whether to flip horizontally, vertically, or both.
