## YouTube Trigger

Watches a YouTube channel and automatically triggers your workflow when a new video is published. Add a channel by handle (e.g. `@mkbhd`) or URL, and optionally set a **Callback URL** to receive webhook notifications.

Best for automating clipping from a creator or channel.

## Google Drive Trigger

Connect a Google Drive folder and Mosaic will monitor it for new files. When a new video lands in the folder, your workflow kicks off automatically.

<Tip>If you have duplicate folder names, use **Browse...** to pick the exact folder.</Tip>

## AWS S3 Trigger

Connect an AWS S3 bucket to automatically trigger workflows when new files are uploaded. Ideal for teams with cloud-based media pipelines.
