The Destination tile lets you export, schedule, or publish your video directly to social platforms from Mosaic — no need to download and re-upload manually.

## How It Works

Add the Destination tile at the end of your workflow. When it runs, Mosaic formats your video for the target platform(s), optionally generates social captions, and publishes or exports.

## Input & Options

### Publishing Mode

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Review before publishing** | Preview and approve posts before they go live |
| **Publish immediately** | Posts go out as soon as they're ready |
| **Export only** | Skip platform publishing — just download the file |

### Publishing Platforms

Connect and publish to:

- X (Twitter)
- LinkedIn
- Instagram
- Facebook
- TikTok
- YouTube

Click **Manage Social Media Integrations** to connect, disconnect, or refresh your accounts. You only need to do this once per account.

### AI Captions for Posts (Optional)

Tell the AI how to write your social media post text.

Examples:

- "Make it witty and add relevant hashtags"
- "Write for LinkedIn with a strong hook and CTA"
- "Write for TikTok using casual language and emojis"

Leave empty for a neutral auto-generated caption.

<Tip>Destination works best at the end of a workflow chain like: [Clips](/tiles/clips) → [Reframe](/tiles/reframe) → [Captions](/tiles/captions) → **Destination**</Tip>
