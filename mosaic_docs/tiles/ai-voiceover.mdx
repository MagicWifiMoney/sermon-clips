Generate a narrated voiceover for your video using AI. This is useful for explainer videos, product demos, documentary-style narration, storytelling, and any situation where spoken audio enhances context.

## How It Works

The AI Voiceover tile takes a written script (or auto-generated script, depending on mode), synthesizes a natural-sounding voice, and aligns it with your video. You choose the voice style and script mode, and Mosaic handles the timing and audio mixing.

## Input and Settings

### Voice

Select from a range of AI voices with different genders, tones, and delivery styles.\
You can preview the selected voice before committing.

Use cases:

- Professional narration (corporate, training, onboarding)
- Energetic narration for social content
- Calm educational explanations

### Script Mode

Choose how the narration script is created.

Modes include:

- **Custom Script:** You provide the exact text
- **(Other modes may include auto-generated, depending on provider)**

If using **Custom Script**, the script field becomes required.

Use cases:

- Precise storytelling
- Product walkthroughs
- Brand-compliant messaging
- Reading long-form copy without re-recording

### Custom Script

Enter the exact text you want spoken in the voiceover.

Best practices:

- Keep sentences short for clarity
- Use punctuation for natural pauses
- Mention on-screen references ("as you can see here…")

### Time Script to Video Moments _(Optional)_

When enabled, Mosaic attempts to align portions of the script with visual beats in the video.

Benefits:

- More dynamic pacing
- Better alignment with scene changes
- Reduces manual timing work
