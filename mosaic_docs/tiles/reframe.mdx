Automatically convert your video into a different aspect ratio (e.g., 9:16 for TikTok, 1:1 for Instagram, 16:9 for YouTube) while keeping the subject in view.

This is essential for repurposing videos across different platforms without manually cropping, zooming, or tracking faces.

## How It Works

The Reframe tile analyzes your footage to detect the main subject and automatically adjusts crop and framing so the important content stays centered, even if the original footage was widescreen or landscape.

## Input & Settings

### 1. Aspect Ratio (Required)

Select the output shape of your video.

Common options:

- **9:16 (Portrait)** — TikTok, Reels, Shorts
- **1:1 (Square)** — Instagram Feed, Facebook
- **16:9 (Landscape)** — YouTube, Desktop
- **Auto** — Detects based on output destination if combined with Destination tile

Choose based on **where you're publishing**.

### 2. Dynamic Zoom (Optional)

Enable this if you want Mosaic to:

- Adjust zoom levels during the clip
- Follow the speaker dynamically
- Create more engaging motion

Useful for:

- Talking-head videos
- Interviews
- Tutorials

Leave off if you want a **static crop**.
