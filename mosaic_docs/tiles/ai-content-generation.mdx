Automatically generate new video content from prompts, scripts, or topics using AI. AI Content Generation is designed for creators who want to produce video from scratch — no camera or footage required.

## How It Works

The AI Content Generation tile takes your text prompt or topic and produces a complete video with visuals, narration, and structure. You define the subject matter, style, and format, and Mosaic handles the rest — generating scenes, selecting or creating visuals, and assembling the final output.

## Input & Settings

### Prompt / Topic

Describe what the video should be about.

Examples:

- "5 tips for productivity while working from home"
- "A 60-second explainer on how solar panels work"
- "An Instagram Reel about the benefits of meditation"

Be specific about the subject, audience, and intended platform for best results.

### Style

Choose the visual and tonal style of the generated content.

Options may include:

- **Educational** — clean, informative, structured
- **Social Media** — fast-paced, bold, attention-grabbing
- **Cinematic** — high production feel, dramatic pacing
- **Corporate** — professional, polished, brand-safe

### Duration

Set the target length of the generated video.

Common options:

- **Short (15–30s)** — TikTok, Reels, Shorts
- **Medium (60–90s)** — Instagram, LinkedIn
- **Long (2–5 min)** — YouTube, training content

### Voice & Narration

Choose whether to include AI-generated narration and select a voice style.

Options:

- **No narration** — visuals and text only
- **Auto-narrate** — AI writes and speaks the script
- **Custom script** — you provide the narration text

## Usage Recommendations

Use AI Content Generation to:

- Rapidly produce social media content at scale
- Create explainer videos from blog posts or articles
- Generate video drafts for brainstorming and iteration
- Build educational or training content without filming

AI Content Generation works great when combined with:

- **Captions** (add subtitles for accessibility and engagement)
- **AI Music** (add a background score)
- **Reframe** (adapt output to different aspect ratios)
- **Destination** (publish directly to social platforms)
