Add a short intro to the beginning of your video. This helps create brand consistency, improve viewer retention, and make your videos feel more professional.

## How It Works

The Intro tile inserts an intro clip **before** your main video. You can choose between Mosaic's built-in intros or upload your own.

## Input & Settings

### Intro Source

Two choices:

1. **Use Mosaic Intro**
   - Mosaic adds a simple, pre-built intro for you.
2. **Use Custom Intro**
   - You upload your own intro clip (e.g., brand bumper, logo reveal, short animation).

Choose **Custom** if you already have branded assets.
