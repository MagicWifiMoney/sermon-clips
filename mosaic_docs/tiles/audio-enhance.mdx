Automatically improve the clarity and quality of your video's audio using AI. This helps make voices sound cleaner, reduces noise, and enhances overall listening experience—especially useful for talking-head videos, podcasts, and interviews.

## How It Works

When applied, Audio Enhance processes your audio track to:

- Reduce background noise
- Improve speech clarity
- Balance audio levels
- Smooth harsh or muffled sections

There are **no settings to configure**—it's designed to be a one-click enhancement.
