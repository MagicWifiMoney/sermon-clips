Automatically removes awkward pauses, long gaps, and dead air from your video to make pacing tighter and more engaging. This is especially useful for podcasts, commentary, educational content, and talking-head videos.

## How It Works

Silence Removal analyzes the audio and:

- Detects segments with no speech
- Cuts or shortens those gaps
- Rejoins the clips smoothly for a natural flow

This saves hours of manual timeline trimming.

## Input & Settings

### Remove Filler Words (Optional)

If enabled, Mosaic can also remove filler words like:

- "um"
- "uh"
- "like"
- "you know"
- "basically"
- "so…"

Set to:

- **Yes** → Removes filler words for cleaner speech
- **No** → Keeps natural speech patterns
