Automatically generate or source relevant B-roll that matches what's being said in your video, helping you increase visual variety, storytelling quality, and audience retention.

AI B-roll is especially useful for **talking-head videos, interviews, podcasts, explainers, and educational content** that benefit from visual support.

## How It Works

The AI B-Roll tile analyzes your video's speech or topics and generates short video shots that match specific keywords, themes, or scenes. It can then overlay these clips automatically at appropriate timestamps.

You can control:

- Amount of B-roll
- Video model
- Aspect ratio
- Whether to generate audio
- Max number of scenes
- Visual style and content focus

## Input & Settings

### Coverage Level

Defines how much B-roll gets added per minute.

Options include (may vary by build):

- **Minimal**
- **Moderate (5 scenes/min)** ← Balanced default
- **High**
- **Maximal**

Use **Minimal** for subtle enhancement and **Maximal** for heavy coverage.

### Video Model

Select which AI model to generate B-roll with.

Example models shown:

- **Kling 1.6**
- Other models depending on the type of output you're aiming for

Different models produce different visual styles (cinematic, realistic, stylized, etc.).

### Aspect Ratio

Controls the shape of generated B-roll.

Options:

- **Auto** (recommended) → Matches your input video or target platform
- **16:9** for YouTube/desktop
- **9:16** for TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- **1:1** for Instagram Feed

Choose based on your **final output format**.

### Generate Audio (Optional)

Toggle to include audio in the generated B-roll.

Notes:

- Not all models support audio
- Useful for cinematic segments
- Not required for overlay-style B-roll

### Max Video Generations

Sets the max number of B-roll scenes to create.

Example from screenshot:

```
50
```

> Some builds may enforce a hard cap (e.g. 20 scenes).

If you set it higher, Mosaic will stop at the model cap.

### Style & Content Prompt (Optional)

Use this to define:

- Visual style
- Subject matter
- Tone / vibe

Examples:

- "Cinematic city skyline shots, wide angle, slow motion"
- "Stock footage of office work and laptops, clean and modern"
- "Playful animated visuals matching educational content"
- "Nature and planet shots, documentary style"

Leave blank to let Mosaic choose based on content.

## Usage Recommendations

Use AI B-roll to:

- Break up long talking segments
- Add visual context to explanations
- Support storytelling
- Improve audience retention

AI B-roll works great when combined with:

- **Clips** (extract highlights first)
- **Reframe** (convert to 9:16 for TikTok)
- **Captions** (add subtitles)
- **AI Music** (background audio)
