Add an outro to the end of your video. Outros help wrap up content cleanly and can encourage viewers to take actions like subscribing, following, or watching the next clip.

## How It Works

The Outro tile inserts an outro clip **after** your main content. You can choose between Mosaic's pre-made outros or upload your own branded outro.

## Input & Settings

### Outro Source

Two choices:

1. **Use Mosaic Outro**
   - Adds a simple, generic outro for quick exports.
2. **Use Custom Outro**
   - Lets you upload your own outro, such as:
     - End cards
     - Social handles
     - Subscribe prompts
     - Brand bumpers

Use **Custom** if you have branding assets.
