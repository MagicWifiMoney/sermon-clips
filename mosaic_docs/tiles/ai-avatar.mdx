Generate a realistic AI-powered avatar to present or narrate your video content. AI Avatar is ideal for creating professional talking-head videos without needing to be on camera.

## How It Works

The AI Avatar tile generates a virtual presenter based on the script and settings you provide. You choose the avatar's appearance, voice, and delivery style, and Mosaic produces a video of the avatar speaking your script with natural lip sync and gestures.

## Input & Settings

### Avatar Selection

Choose from a library of AI-generated presenters with different appearances, genders, and styles.

Use cases:

- Corporate training and onboarding videos
- Product explainers and demos
- Educational content and tutorials
- Social media content where you don't want to be on camera

### Script

Provide the text for the avatar to speak.

Best practices:

- Keep sentences concise and conversational
- Use punctuation for natural pauses
- Break long scripts into logical sections
- Write as if speaking to someone directly

### Voice

Select a voice style that matches the avatar and your content's tone.

Options vary by avatar, but typically include:

- **Professional** — clear and authoritative
- **Friendly** — warm and approachable
- **Energetic** — upbeat and engaging

### Language

Choose the language for the avatar's speech. Multiple languages are supported for global content creation.

## Usage Recommendations

Use AI Avatar to:

- Create presenter-led videos without filming
- Produce multilingual content at scale
- Add a human touch to explainer or tutorial videos
- Build consistent brand spokesperson content

AI Avatar works great when combined with:

- **AI B-Roll** (add visual variety behind the avatar)
- **AI Music** (add background score)
- **Captions** (add subtitles for accessibility)
- **Reframe** (adapt to different platforms)
