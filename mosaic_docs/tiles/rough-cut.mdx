Automatically create a rough cut from your raw footage by keeping the meaningful sections and removing filler, silence, or irrelevant content — based on your creative intent.

This tile is useful when you want to quickly condense long-form footage into a cleaner baseline edit without manually scrubbing timelines.

## How It Works

The Rough Cut tile analyzes your footage and applies edits based on **your prompt**, not just simple silence trimming. You tell Mosaic what kind of cut you want, and it will:

- Detect meaningful segments
- Remove dead air or unimportant parts
- Preserve emotional, narrative, or informational beats
- Produce a condensed timeline you can build on

## Input Fields

### Creative Intent Prompt (Required)

This prompt defines the _logic_ of your cut — **what stays** and **what gets cut**.

Examples:

- "Highlight only the parts where the speaker gives key takeaways."
- "Cut everything except the emotional or dramatic beats."
- "Make an efficient, fast-paced summary version under 90 seconds."

### Quick Suggestions

For users who don't know what to write, Mosaic offers preset buttons for common patterns like storytelling, narrative, tone, and mood-based cuts.

## Best Use Cases

- Long podcast → short narrative episode
- Interview → highlight reel
- Commentary → tight opinion piece
- Vlog → emotional storyline
- Raw footage → clip-ready baseline

## What Comes Next

Rough Cut produces a clean foundation you can send to:

- [**Clips**](/tiles/clips) — extract short-form highlights
- [**Captions**](/tiles/captions) — add subtitles
- [**Reframe**](/tiles/reframe) — convert to 9:16 for TikTok
- [**Montage**](/tiles/montage) — build a beat-matched sequence
- [**Destination**](/tiles/destination) — export or publish

<Accordion title="Pro Tips" icon="lightbulb">

- The more specific your prompt, the better the cut
- Mention **what to keep**, not just what to remove
- Include mood cues if you care about emotional curation (e.g. "uplifting," "funny," "tense")
- If you want short-form highlights, combine Rough Cut with [Clips](/tiles/clips)
