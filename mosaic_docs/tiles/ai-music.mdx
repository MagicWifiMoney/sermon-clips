Generate custom AI-composed music that matches your video's mood, pacing, and style. Useful for creators who want original, copyright-safe background music without hunting through libraries.

## How It Works

The AI Music tile analyzes your video (if enabled) and generates a score that fits the visual context. You can leave it fully automatic or guide it with prompts and settings.

## Input and Settings

### Intelligent Video Analysis

When enabled, Mosaic inspects your video to determine mood, intensity, genre, BPM, and timing.

Use when:

- You want music that "just fits"
- You don't want to configure settings manually
- The video carries clear emotional or pacing cues

### Prompt (Optional)

Describe the mood/style you want.

Examples:

- _"Chill lofi background with soft drums"_
- _"Epic orchestral build-up for cinematic travel footage"_
- _"Corporate ambient for a product demo"_

Use when:

- You want creative direction
- You don't want full auto
- You want a specific genre or vibe

### Genre (Optional)

Choose the category of music (e.g., EDM, Acoustic, Ambient, Cinematic, Corporate)

Use cases:

- _Ambient_ → tutorial voiceovers
- _Cinematic_ → travel edits
- _Corporate_ → product demos
- _EDM_ → fast montage edits

**Tip:** Leave on **Auto** for best scene-matching.

### Mood (Optional)

Controls emotional tone (e.g., Calm, Energetic, Dramatic, Dark, Happy)

Use when:

- The scene's emotion is clear
- You want specific storytelling vibes

### Intensity (Optional)

Adjusts how "big" or "dense" the music feels.

Levels:

- **Low** → subtle background
- **Medium** → balanced presence
- **High** → impactful or dramatic

### BPM (Optional)

Sets musical tempo (Beats Per Minute).

Mapping:

- **60–80 BPM** → slow, emotional
- **90–120 BPM** → balanced
- **130–160+ BPM** → energetic

Use when your edit follows rhythmic cuts.

### Style (Optional)

Further refines the musical aesthetic (e.g., Cinematic, Ambient, Retro, Corporate)

Use cases:

- "Ambient" for explainer voiceovers
- "Cinematic" for travel or story edits
- "Corporate" for product demos

### Timing (Optional)

Allows partial coverage:

- **Start Time (s)**
- **End Time (s)**

Use when:

- Music should appear only in montage sections
- You want intro music only
- You want outro music only
