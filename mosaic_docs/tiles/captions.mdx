Add dynamic, stylized captions that match your video's tone, improve retention, and boost accessibility. Ideal for social platforms where _sound-off viewing_ is common (TikTok, Reels, Shorts, LinkedIn).

## How It Works

The Captions tile listens to your video audio, transcribes speech, and overlays timed captions. You control how they look — from fonts and stroke to placement and coloring.

Captions are auto-timed to speech and update in real-time based on your styling choices.

## Input and Settings

### Caption Style

Controls how captions are visually rendered.

Common styles:

- **Colored Words** → Highlights key words for engagement
- **Stroke Text** → Outlined text for readability
- **Full Highlight** → Blocks/background for high contrast

Great for:

- Retention editing
- Educational clips
- Talking-head explanatory content

### Colors

You can customize three visual layers:

**Base Color**\
Default text color (e.g., `#FFFFFF` for white)

**Highlight Color**\
Used to emphasize specific words — increases engagement & readability

**Stroke Color**\
Outline around text for contrast on busy footage

### Font Options

Set the typography style to match your brand.

Controls include:

- **Font Family** (e.g., Montserrat)
- **Font Weight** (e.g., 400 / 700)
- **Font Size** (slider)

Use cases:

- Bold fonts for TikTok/Shorts
- Light/fonts for cinematic edits

### Vertical Position

Adjust how high/low captions sit in the frame (via percentage slider).

Examples:

- `90%` → Just above bottom edge (common for shorts)
- `50%` → Centered (cinematic)
- `20%` → Top aligned (when lower third is busy)

### Words per Caption

Controls pacing and readability.

Two sliders:

- **Minimum words**
- **Maximum words**

Examples:

- `Min 1 / Max 3` → Fast TikTok pacing
- `Min 3 / Max 7` → YouTube educational pacing
