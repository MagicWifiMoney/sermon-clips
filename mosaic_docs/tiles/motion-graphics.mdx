Add motion graphics and animations to your video to emphasize information, highlight talking points, or create a more engaging visual storytelling style.

Motion graphics are AI-generated based on your instructions. They can appear as overlays during speech, fullscreen explainer slides, or contextual inserts depending on how you configure the tile.

## How It Works

The Motion Graphics tile takes in your video and a **prompt describing the type of motion graphics you want**, then generates visual elements that match your style and intent.

## Input Fields & Controls

### Style Prompt (Required)

Describe the **visual style** and **function** of the graphics.

Examples:

- "Cinematic Vox-style graphics that explain the talking points"
- "Minimal tech UI diagrams with arrows and labels"
- "Playful YouTube-style pop-up text for comedic emphasis"
- "Infographic overlays using bold colors and icons"

### Full Screen Toggle (Optional)

When **enabled**, motion graphics appear as fullscreen slides — the speaker video may cut away entirely. Best for explainers, charts, and data slides.

When **disabled** (default), graphics appear as overlays on top of your video. Ideal for speaking-head, narrative, or commentary videos.

### Reference Links (Optional)

Comma-separated URLs the AI will research for factual content (e.g., product pages, Wikipedia articles, docs).

### Style Reference Video (Optional)

Paste a **YouTube link** to replicate a specific visual style. Mosaic analyzes typography, color schemes, transitions, and layout from the reference.

### Style Suggestions (Quick Buttons)

Common presets like **VOX Style** and **Ali Abdaal Style** that instantly fill the prompt for you.

<Note>For longer videos (over ~1–2 minutes), this tile may time out. We're actively working on removing this limitation. For now, it works best with **short clips, intros, and explainers**.</Note>

## Best Use Cases

Motion Graphics works great for explainers, educational content, product breakdowns, tutorials, commentary videos, and infographic storytelling. It boosts retention when explaining complex topics.
