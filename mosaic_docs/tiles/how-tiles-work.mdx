- Double click on the canvas to see the tile option
- The **first tile** is usually a **Video Input** tile
- You then connect **creation tiles** or **action tiles** to it
- Mosaic performs the actions in order
- Outputs get passed along the chain

Tiles make editing understandable even for first-time users.

## Mental Model for Tiles

Understanding the three types of tiles is key to getting the most out of Mosaic:

- **Input Tiles** bring media in — they are the starting point of every workflow (e.g. Video Input, YouTube Trigger)
- **Creation Tiles** generate new media — they produce entirely new content like AI-generated B-roll, avatars, voiceovers, or music
- **Action Tiles** modify media — they transform existing media by adding captions, reframing, trimming silence, color correcting, etc.

Every workflow follows this flow: **Input → Creation / Action → Output**. Once this clicks, building any workflow becomes intuitive.
