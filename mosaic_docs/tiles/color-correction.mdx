Apply color grading to your video to improve mood, consistency, or cinematic style. This tile lets you use preset LUTs, custom LUTs, or match the look of a reference image.

## How It Works

Color Correction adjusts the color profile of your footage. You choose one grading method (preset, reference image, or custom LUT), and Mosaic applies that look across your video.

## Input & Settings

### 1. Preset LUT

Select a ready-made look such as:

- Golden Hour
- Filmic
- Vibrant
- Cool Tones
- Neutral Clean

**Best for:**\
Fast results when you don't want to think about color science.

### 2. Reference Image

Upload an image whose color style you want to match.

**Example:**\
Upload a still from a movie → Mosaic matches that cinematic look.

**Best for:**\
Brand aesthetics or mood matching.

### 3. Custom LUT (.cube)

Upload your own **.cube LUT** file exported from:

- DaVinci Resolve
- Premiere Pro
- Final Cut
- Photoshop
- Other grading software

**Best for:**\
Colorists or agencies with existing grading pipelines.
