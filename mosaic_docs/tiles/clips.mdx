Automatically extract short, standalone clips from a longer video. These clips are moments that can be shared directly on social platforms or used in editing workflows.

This tile is ideal for repurposing podcasts, interviews, webinars, or speaking content into short-form highlights.

## How It Works

Mosaic scans your video and finds segments that contain interesting, insightful, funny, emotional, or impactful moments.

You can:

- **Let Mosaic decide** what's interesting, or
- **Guide it** using your own prompt (optional)

Each clip becomes an individual video you can send to other tiles (like Reframe or Captions) or export directly.

## Input Options

### 1. Prompt (Optional)

> _"Write what kind of video you want to create"_

Use this if you want specific types of clips.\
Examples:

- "Educational tips and insights"
- "Funny reactions"
- "Motivational quotes"
- "Controversial takes or debates"
- "Moments explaining frameworks or concepts"

If you leave it **empty**, Mosaic will return a variety of interesting moments by default.

### 2. Number of Clips (max)

Set how many clips you want.\
Example: `10` → returns up to 10 clips.

If unsure, **set a number higher than you need** and filter later.

### 3. Target Duration (seconds)

How long each clip should roughly be.

Examples:

- `15` for TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- `30–60` for YouTube or Twitter clips

This is a target, not an exact enforcement — clips may vary slightly for natural context.

## Best Use Cases

Use the Clips tile when you want to quickly generate short videos from long footage, such as:

- Podcasts → TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- Interviews → Highlight moments
- Webinars → Key insights
- Reaction videos → Funny parts
- Commentary streams → Shareable segments
