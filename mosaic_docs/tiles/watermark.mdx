Add a watermark or logo to your video for branding, ownership, or attribution. Useful for creators, brands, agencies, or clients who want consistent visual identity across content.

## How It Works

The Watermark tile places an image overlay (logo or watermark) on top of your final video. You can use Mosaic's default branding or upload your own logo for custom branding.

## Input & Settings

### Logo Source

Choose one:

- **Use Mosaic Logo** — Quick default branding
- **Use Custom Logo** — Upload your own PNG/JPG (recommended for creators & brands)

### Position

Pick where the watermark should appear. Common presets include:

- Bottom Right (default)
- Bottom Left
- Top Right
- Top Left
- Center

Choose based on platform and composition.

### Size

Adjusts logo size as a percentage of video width.\
Example from screenshot:

- **30% of width** → medium branding

### Opacity

Controls visibility (0–100%).\
Examples:

- **20–40%** → subtle watermark
- **70–100%** → strong visible branding

### Margin

Adds spacing (in pixels) from the video edges to avoid clipping or interference with captions.
