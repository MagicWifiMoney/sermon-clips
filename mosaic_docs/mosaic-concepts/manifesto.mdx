Mosaic exists because video is becoming the language of the internet, but modern video workflows are:

- Slow
- Manual
- Hard to scale
- Hard to learn

We believe:
- Anyone should be able to edit
- Editing should be creative, not technical
- Workflows should be reusable
- Platforms should be respected (TikTok ≠ YouTube)
- Video automation should be native, not a hack

Our mission is simple: Give everyone the power to turn ideas into video.
