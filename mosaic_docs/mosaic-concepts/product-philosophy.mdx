Mosaic is built for creators, editors, and teams who need fast, consistent, scalable editing without sacrificing quality. Here are the six principles that guide every design decision:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Visual over text" icon="eye">
  People think visually — so workflows should be visual. Instead of writing scripts or navigating menus, you connect tiles on a canvas and see your workflow take shape in real time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tiles over timelines" icon="grid-2">
  Editing is a series of decisions. Tiles express those decisions clearly — each one represents a single creative or technical choice, making complex workflows easy to understand at a glance.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smart defaults" icon="sliders">
  Most users shouldn't need to configure 100 knobs. Mosaic ships with intelligent defaults so you can get great results immediately, and fine-tune only when you want to.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Simple first, powerful later" icon="layer-group">
  Beginners should be able to publish in 5 minutes. Power users can go deeper with prompts, model selection, and API automation. The complexity is there — it's just not in the way.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Platform awareness" icon="mobile-screen">
  9:16 is not 16:9 — formats matter. Mosaic understands where your content is going and adapts framing, pacing, and style to fit the platform.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Results over tools" icon="bullseye">
  Users care about outcomes, not software. Every feature in Mosaic exists to get you from raw footage to published content faster — nothing more, nothing less.
