# Mosaic API

Mosaic provides a powerful API for automating professional-grade video editing with AI-powered agents. Upload videos, run pre-built workflows, and receive polished outputs programmatically.

## Base URL

```text
https://api.mosaic.so
```

## Core Concepts

### Agent
A pre-built video editing workflow that can be executed via the API. Create and configure agents at [edit.mosaic.so](https://edit.mosaic.so).

### Agent Run
An execution instance of an agent that processes your videos. Track progress and retrieve outputs through the run ID.

### Triggers
Automated agent execution based on external events (e.g., new YouTube videos).

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key prefixed with `mk_`.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
     https://api.mosaic.so/agent/[agent_id]/run
```

Test your API key with the `/whoami` endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mk_your_api_key" \
     https://api.mosaic.so/whoami
```
