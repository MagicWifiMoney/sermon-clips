# @clipyoursermons — TikTok Week 2 Scripts
**Created:** 2026-02-21  
**Account:** @clipyoursermons (TikTok ID: 44765)  
**Theme:** Easter prep — 6 weeks out, biggest content opportunity of the year  
**Format:** 30-60 second vertical video (9:16) — talk-to-camera or screen demo  
**Tone:** Urgent but helpful — "you have time if you start NOW"

---

## 📌 Week 2 Pillars
1. **Easter urgency** — 6 weeks is enough, but only if you start now
2. **Workflow education** — what the AI-powered Easter content pipeline looks like
3. **Social proof / before-after** — show what a church with clips looks like vs without
4. **Platform-specific tips** — where Easter content actually works (Reels vs TikTok vs YouTube)

## Script 1 — "Easter is in 6 Weeks" (Urgency Hook)
**Slot:** Monday, Mar 2 | **Length:** ~30 sec | **Format:** Talking head (casual, coffee cup visible)

### Hook (0–3 sec)
> **ON SCREEN TEXT:** "Easter is 6 weeks away. Is your church ready? 🐣"  
> *[Speaker looks directly at camera, half-concerned smile]*

### Body (3–24 sec)
> "Easter is the single biggest Sunday of the year for almost every church.  
> More visitors. More eyes on your socials. More people Googling your church name.  
> And yet — most church media teams are going to scramble the week before with zero content plan.  
> Here's the thing: 6 weeks is actually plenty of time.  
> But only if you start building your Easter clip strategy THIS week."

### CTA (24–30 sec)
> "Follow @clipyoursermons — we're dropping an Easter content calendar this week. Free. Steal it."

**Caption:**
```
Easter Sunday is April 5 🐣

## Script 2 — "What Viral Looks Like for Churches" (Education)
**Slot:** Wednesday, Mar 4 | **Length:** ~45 sec | **Format:** Talking head + text overlays

### Hook (0–3 sec)
> **ON SCREEN TEXT:** "This type of sermon clip gets 10x more views. Here's why ✂️"  
> *[Speaker holds up fingers — confident, direct]*

### Body (3–38 sec)
> "I analyzed 500 sermon clips that went viral — here's what they had in common.  
>  
> Number one: They started with a QUESTION.  
> Not a statement. A question.  
> 'What would happen if you actually believed what you prayed?'  
> That one line — people stop scrolling immediately.  
>  
> Number two: They were UNDER 60 seconds.  
> Not two minutes. Not five minutes. Under 60.  
> The algorithm pushes completion rate. Short clips finish. Long clips don't.  
>  
> Number three: Captions were ON.  
> 85% of TikTok is watched with no sound.  
> No captions = half your message doesn't land.  
>  
> The good news? An AI tool can pull the best question moments from your sermon, cut them to 60 seconds, and add captions — automatically."

### CTA (38–45 sec)
> "Link in bio — we'll show you what that looks like for your next sermon."

**Caption:**
```
Viral sermon clips follow a pattern 🎤

After studying hundreds of them, the formula is simple:
• Opens with a QUESTION (not a statement)
• Under 60 seconds
• Captions ON (85% watch muted)

The best part? AI can find these moments in your full sermon automatically. No editing experience needed.

### Hook (0–3 sec)

> *[Speaker smiles, pulls up phone like they're about to share a secret]*

### Body (3–48 sec)
> "Here's exactly what a church with a great Easter social presence does — starting 6 weeks out.  
>  
> **Weeks 1–2:** Pull 3–5 clips from past Easter or Lent sermons. Post them with the caption: 'Getting ready for Easter Sunday April 5th — here's what we believe about [topic].'  
>  
> **Weeks 3–4:** Post one piece of Easter-specific content per week. Quote cards. Short reels. A 'what to expect at Easter service' video. These drive Google searches.  
>  
> **Week 5:** Go hard. Daily content. Palm Sunday clip. Good Friday reflection. Behind-the-scenes service prep.  
>  
> **Easter Sunday:** Live or same-day clip drop. This is your biggest reach day of the year. Don't waste it.  
>  
> **The week after:** Post the 3 best moments from Easter Sunday. Momentum doesn't stop on Sunday."

## Script 4 — "The 30-Second Visitor Decision" (Emotional / Mission)
**Slot:** Sunday, Mar 8 | **Length:** ~35 sec | **Format:** Talking head, quieter / reflective tone

### Hook (0–3 sec)
> **ON SCREEN TEXT:** "Someone is going to visit your church on Easter because of a clip 🎤"  
> *[Speaker pauses, lets it land]*

### Body (3–28 sec)
> "Here's a story that keeps coming up.  
> A pastor puts a 45-second clip on TikTok — just one line from his sermon about grief.  
> A woman scrolling at midnight, going through a divorce, sees it.  
> She watches three more of his clips.  
> She shows up Easter Sunday.  
>  
> That clip cost him nothing. He didn't edit it. His media team used an AI tool.  
> But it changed her year.  
>  
> Easter is 6 weeks away.  
> There's someone out there right now who needs to hear what your pastor said last Sunday."

### CTA (28–35 sec)
> "Start clipping. Follow @clipyoursermons for a free Easter content strategy."

**Caption:**
```
Someone will walk into your church on Easter Sunday because of a clip they saw online.

They won't tell you why they came. They'll just show up.

That's why Easter content matters so much — it's not marketing. It's ministry.

Start clipping. Free Easter content plan at the link 🐣
