## CONTENT SERIES 1: Price Transparency Thread
**Platform:** Twitter/X (4-tweet thread)  
**Angle:** Show the market what sermon content tools actually cost — educational, not a direct attack  
**Best posting time:** Mon/Tue 9–11 AM CST (when church media directors are at desks)

### Tweet 1 (hook)
```
The hidden cost of sermon clips nobody talks about 🧵

We looked at every major tool. Here's what churches are actually paying.
```

### Tweet 2
```
Option 1: Human transcription + manual editing

• Rev transcription: $1.50/min → $67 for a 45-min sermon
• CapCut/Premiere editing: 3-5 hours of volunteer time
• Total per sermon: $67 + ~$150 in time (at $30/hr volunteer rate)
• Monthly (4 sermons): ~$875

That's almost $10,500/year.
```

```
Option 2: The leading AI sermon clip tool

• SermonShots Plus (clips only): $49.99/mo
• SermonShots Silver (clips + content gen): $67/mo  
• Gold (everything): $97/mo

Better. But clips-only at $50/mo still doesn't include blog posts, devotionals, or study guides.
```

### Tweet 4
```
Option 3: Sermon Clips

• Starter (clips + transcription): $29/mo
• Growth (clips + transcription + multilingual + publishing): $59/mo

Same clips. 30+ languages. Direct social publishing.

For $29/mo less than their clips-only plan.

## CONTENT SERIES 2: Multilingual Spotlight
**Platform:** Instagram (carousel) + LinkedIn (long-form) + Twitter/X (thread)  
**Angle:** 30% of US churches serve non-English speakers — this is an underserved need  
**Best posting time:** Wed 12–2 PM CST

### Instagram Caption (Reel or carousel)
```
30% of US churches have non-English speaking members.

Most sermon tools ignore them entirely. 🌍

Here's what it looks like when your church has both an English AND Spanish service — and your media team runs on two volunteers:

Before: English clips get posted. Spanish service gets nothing. Every week.

After: Upload once. Get clips with captions in both English and Spanish (or Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, French...). Post to both audiences. Same workflow.

That's the 30+ language difference.

Sermon Clips auto-generates captions and translations in 30+ languages from a single sermon upload.

Your whole congregation. Not just the English speakers.

- **Slide 4:** Languages list: Spanish · Korean · Mandarin · Portuguese · French · Arabic · Hindi · more
- **Slide 5:** "Start free → sermonclips.com" (CTA card)

### Twitter/X Thread (multilingual)
```
Tweet 1:
Most church social media tools are built for English-only churches.

That's a problem for 30% of US congregations. 🧵

Tweet 2:
Here's what a typical bilingual church media team looks like:

• 1 English service, 1 Spanish service
• 1-2 volunteers managing both
• English clips get posted
• Spanish service gets... nothing

Not because they don't care. Because the tools don't help.

Tweet 3:
What should happen:

Upload the sermon once →
AI transcribes in English →
Generates clips with English captions →
Translates captions to Spanish →
Ready to post for both audiences

That's 30 minutes of work. Not 3 hours x2.

Tweet 4:
Sermon Clips supports 30+ languages for captions and translation.

Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, French, Arabic, Hindi, Japanese — and more.

One upload. Your whole congregation.

### LinkedIn Post
```
There's a quiet inequity happening in church social media.

Churches with English-speaking congregations post clips every week. Their members can watch the sermon highlights on their commute, share them with friends, engage with the message through the week.

Churches with Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, or Portuguese-speaking congregations? Their clips often don't get captions. Or the workflow doubles the work. So they don't post at all.

According to Pew Research, roughly 30% of US churches serve congregations with significant non-English speaking populations.

The tech hasn't caught up. Most AI sermon tools support English and maybe a handful of languages. Translation is treated as an add-on, not a default.

We built Sermon Clips with multilingual as a core feature, not an afterthought. Upload your sermon in English — get clips with captions automatically translated into 30+ languages, including Spanish, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, French, Arabic, and Hindi.

One upload. One workflow. Your whole congregation.

If you work in church communications or serve a multilingual congregation, this is worth knowing about.

## CONTENT SERIES 4: Promote /sermon-transcription page
**Platform:** Facebook · LinkedIn · Instagram  
**Angle:** "The $67 problem" — human transcription is expensive and a dead end  
**Best posting time:** Tue 10 AM CST (Facebook), Mon 9 AM CST (LinkedIn)

### Facebook Post
```
Quick question for church media directors:

How much did you spend on sermon transcription last year?

If you used Rev ($1.50/min), a 45-minute sermon costs $67.50. Times 52 Sundays — that's $3,510 just for transcripts.

And you still don't have clips. You still don't have captions. You still don't have a blog post or study guide.

AI transcription changes this math completely.

With Sermon Clips:
• 45-minute sermon transcribed in 3-5 minutes
• Accuracy: 95-98% (lapel mic), 93-97% (podium mic)
• Cost: included in your $29/month plan
• Also generates: clips, captions, blog posts, study guides

First sermon is free. No credit card.

→ sermonclips.com/sermon-transcription
```

### LinkedIn Post
```
The math on human sermon transcription doesn't work anymore.

Rev: $1.50/minute × 45 minutes = $67.50 per sermon
Scribie: $0.80/minute × 45 minutes = $36 per sermon

Weekly sermon, 52 weeks = $1,872–$3,510/year just for transcripts. Before any editing. Before any clips. Before any social content.

AI transcription in 2026 runs at 95-98% accuracy with a standard lapel mic. A 45-minute sermon processes in 3-5 minutes. And with the right tool, that transcript immediately powers your clips, captions, blog posts, and study guides.

The only thing human transcription still wins on is accuracy in very difficult audio conditions. Everything else — speed, cost, downstream content generation — AI wins.

If your church is still using human transcription services, the ROI case for switching is probably stronger than you think.

## CONTENT SERIES 5: Promote /alternatives/opus-clip page
**Platform:** Twitter/X · LinkedIn  
**Angle:** Educational — for churches who've tried Opus Clip and found it lacking  
**Best posting time:** Thu 11 AM CST

### Twitter/X
```
Opus Clip is a great tool.

For podcasters.

For churches, it misses a lot:
❌ No sermon-specific clip detection
❌ No discussion guide or devotional generation
❌ Starts at $15/mo for 150 min (one sermon burns that)
❌ Not built for church publishing workflows

We built the church version.

→ sermonclips.com/alternatives/opus-clip
#churchmedia #opusclip
```

### LinkedIn
```
A question I hear regularly from church communications directors:

"We tried Opus Clip but it doesn't really work for sermons. What else is out there?"

Opus Clip is purpose-built for podcasters and content creators — it's excellent at that. But for sermon content, the clip detection misses the moments that matter to congregations: the illustration that lands, the moment the room goes quiet, the question that sticks.

Sermon-specific AI understands that structure. It knows the difference between a five-minute build-up and a 60-second highlight. It finds the clips your church media team would have found — without the 3-hour scrub.

We wrote a full comparison (no fluff) at sermonclips.com/alternatives/opus-clip

Worth bookmarking if you're evaluating tools for your church.

## Notes
- All links use sermonclips.com — domain must be live before posting
- Series 1 (price thread) is highest-stakes — gets screenshotted and shared
- Multilingual angle is underserved in church tech Twitter — strong differentiation play
- Don't post Series 3 ("we're cheaper") before the domain is live — drives traffic to a parked page
- Series 5 Opus Clip posts should include the page link — don't rely on "link in bio" for LinkedIn
