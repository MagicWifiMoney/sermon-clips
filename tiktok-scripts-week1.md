# @clipyoursermons — TikTok Week 1 Scripts
**Created:** 2026-02-20  
**Account:** @clipyoursermons (TikTok ID: 44765)  
**Strategy:** Attract church media directors, pastors, and comms volunteers who want to repurpose sermons for social  
**Format:** 30-60 second vertical video (9:16) — talk-to-camera or screen demo over sermon footage  
**Tone:** Helpful, relatable, low-production — no over-polish

---

## 📌 Content Pillars (from research)
1. **Pain point hooks** — "Does this sound familiar?" moments for church comms people
2. **How-to / quick wins** — Show them what's possible in 60 sec
3. **Social proof / transformation** — Before vs after a church's content game
4. **Sermon clip examples** — Show actual clips that work on TikTok (the format education)
5. **Behind the scenes** — The clip creation workflow

## Script 1 — "The Sunday Backlog" (Pain Point)
**Slot:** Monday | **Length:** ~30 sec | **Format:** Talking head (phone camera, casual)

### Hook (0–3 sec)
> **ON SCREEN TEXT:** "Every Monday morning for church media people 💀"  
> *[Speaker looks stressed/tired, sips coffee]*

### Body (3–25 sec)
> "Sunday was incredible. The pastor said something that literally made everyone in the room go silent.  
> And now it's Monday — and that moment is just… sitting on a hard drive.  
> Not on TikTok. Not on Instagram. Not anywhere.  
> Meanwhile, your church's social page posted nothing last week either.  
> Sound familiar?"

### CTA (25–30 sec)
> "Follow @clipyoursermons — this week we're showing exactly how to fix that.  
> Your message deserves to reach more than just the room it was preached in."

## Script 2 — "The 3-Second Rule" (Education / Hook Strategy)
**Slot:** Wednesday | **Length:** ~45 sec | **Format:** Talking head + text overlays

### Hook (0–3 sec)
> **ON SCREEN TEXT:** "Your sermon clips are failing because of this ONE mistake ❌"  
> *[Speaker points at camera, serious face]*

### Body (3–38 sec)
> "On TikTok, you have THREE seconds before someone scrolls past you.  
> Three. Seconds.  
>   
> Here's what most church accounts do wrong — they start with 'Good morning, welcome to City Church'…  
> [buzzer sound] Scrolled.  
>   
> Here's what actually works:  
> Start with the *punchline*. Start with the *pain*. Start with the moment in the sermon that made everyone go 'Wow.'  
>   
> Find that one sentence — that one 'Did he just say that??' moment — and make THAT your first three seconds.  
>   
> When you do that? People stop. They watch. They share."

### CTA (38–45 sec)
> "What's the most powerful moment from your pastor's last sermon?  
> Drop it in the comments — I want to see it.  
> Follow for more on turning sermons into content that actually spreads."

**Caption:**

The 3-second rule is everything on TikTok 🎯

Most church accounts lose viewers before they even get to the good part. Here's the fix: lead with the moment that would make someone stop mid-scroll.

> *[Speaker looks into camera with raised eyebrows]*

### Body (3–48 sec)
> "Most church media teams treat Sunday like a one-time event.  
> But one sermon has enough content for an entire week. Here's how to break it down:  
>   
> **Monday:** Post a 30-second clip of the most emotional moment  
> **Tuesday:** Pull one quote from the sermon — text on a clean background  
> **Wednesday:** Behind the scenes — quick clip of setup, rehearsal, or the vibe  
> **Thursday:** A question from the message for your community to answer  
> **Friday:** Highlight a testimony or response from the congregation  
> **Saturday:** Reminder clip — 'Catch up on Sunday's message, link in bio'  
> **Sunday:** Preview of what's coming  
>   
> One sermon. Seven touchpoints. Zero extra filming."

### CTA (48–55 sec)
> "Save this video — you'll want to come back to it.  
> Which day are you going to start with?  
> Comment below and follow for more."

> *[Pause — let it land]*

### Body (3–33 sec)
> "There's someone right now who isn't going to church.  
> Maybe they used to. Maybe they've been hurt, or burned out, or they just… drifted.  
>   
> But they're on TikTok. They're scrolling.  
>   
> And if you posted that 45-second clip from last Sunday's message — the one where your pastor talked about being enough, or being forgiven, or coming home —  
> that person might stop scrolling.  
>   
> That's the reach that sermon clips have.  
> That's not marketing. That's ministry."

### CTA (33–40 sec)
> "Follow @clipyoursermons — we help churches turn their sermons into content that finds the people who need it most.  
> What sermon topic do you wish you'd had a clip of this week?"

**Caption:**  
```

> *[Speaker leans toward camera]*

### Body (3–28 sec)
> "Here's the simplest test to know if your church's TikTok is working:  
>   
> Can you find 3 moments from last Sunday's sermon that would make someone stop scrolling?  
>   
> Not a moment where the pastor says 'good morning.'  
> Not the offering announcement.  
>   
> THREE moments where someone who's never stepped inside your church would watch to the end.  
>   
> If you can find 3? You've got a week of content.  
> If you can't? That's a signal — your clips need better hooks."

### CTA (28–35 sec)
> "Try it this week. Come back and tell me what you found.  
> If you need help identifying those moments, follow us — that's exactly what we teach.  
> Drop a 🔥 if you're going to try this."
