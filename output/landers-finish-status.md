## What Was Built

### ✅ Use-Case Pages (4 total)
Following the exact pattern from `sermon-to-social/page.tsx`:

1. **`app/use-cases/multi-platform/page.tsx`**
   - "One sermon, every platform, every format"
   - Pain: Reformatting for TikTok vs YouTube vs Instagram is exhausting
   - Before/After: 90min saved per clip
   - Stats: 5x platform coverage, 100% format consistency

2. **`app/use-cases/captions-and-subtitles/page.tsx`**
   - "Perfect captions without tedious editing"
   - Pain: Manual captioning takes forever, auto-captions are trash
   - Before/After: AI + human review = 100% accuracy
   - Stats: 85% watch muted, 40% higher engagement

3. **`app/use-cases/youtube-automation/page.tsx`**
   - "Connect YouTube, we handle the rest"
   - Pain: Remembering to upload/clip every week, zero-touch workflow
   - Before/After: Set it and forget it automation
   - Stats: 52x more videos/year, 340% subscriber growth

4. **`app/use-cases/church-growth/page.tsx`**
   - "Turn your online presence into real church growth"
   - Pain: Posting but not growing, no strategy
   - Before/After: Strategic content that converts
   - Stats: +127 families in 1 year, 82% found us on social

### ✅ About Page (`app/about/page.tsx`)

- **Trust Signals** — 500+ churches, 10,000+ clips, 24hr turnaround, 4.9★ rating

### ✅ Mission Page (`app/mission/page.tsx`)
- **Biblical Framing** — "Every message deserves to be heard beyond Sunday"
- **The Problem** — Life-changing sermons locked in 45-min videos, never seen by those who need them
- **Stewardship** — Great Commission, Mark 16:15, digital mission field
- **The Stats**:
  - 5.1B people online daily
  - 73% use social for answers
  - 2.5hr daily social media use

### ✅ Index Pages (2 total)

1. **`app/for/page.tsx`**
   - Grid of cards linking to each persona page
   - Communications Directors, Social Media Managers, Media Directors, Pastors, Small Churches
   - Highlight stats for each (e.g., "Save 4+ hours per week")

2. **`app/use-cases/page.tsx`**
   - Grid of cards linking to each use-case page
   - Problem/solution format for each
   - Stats badges (e.g., "Save 3.5hrs/week", "90min saved per clip")
